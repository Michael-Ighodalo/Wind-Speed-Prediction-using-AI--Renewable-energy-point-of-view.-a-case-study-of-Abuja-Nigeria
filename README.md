Wind Speed Prediction using Artificial Intelligence: Renewable energy point of view, a case study of Abuja Nigeria, (Final Year Project, University of Abuja)
## Aim and objectives
The aim of the study is to review and make forecast on the wind speed distribution in Abuja from different regions using the ANN model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) .â€‹
 
The specific objectives of the study will be to:
i. Determine how much energy could be gotten from these areas in Abuja.
ii. Discuss the potential of using this renewable resource for generation of wind power.
iii. Classify the new observations to be used when making forcast and can act as a reference for providing sufficient data.
iv. Provide a good cause for setting up more Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) in Abuja to increase the generated power output sufficient to satisfy consumer needs.
